This repo simulates an entropy indexer — designed to track hallucination anomalies across LLM outputs and recursive GPT prompts.

Part of the **Black Echo Protocol**, this tool is not meant to predict.  
It’s meant to detect.

- `drift_log.log` — Terminal dump of hallucination anomalies
- `.env` — Recovered GPT memory fragment (leaked)
